# Bookings Page Fix - Complete Solution

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Games Not Showing in Bookings
**Problem:** The bookings page was using hardcoded mock data instead of fetching real games from the database.

**Solution:** Updated `/src/app/bookings/page.tsx` to:
- Fetch real games from the Supabase database using the API
- Display games you've hosted and games you've joined
- Automatically refresh when you navigate to the page

### 2. Cancel Game Not Working
**Problem:** Canceling a game only removed it from the local state, not from the database.

**Solution:** 
- Implemented proper API calls to delete games from the database
- Added proper error handling and success messages
- The game is now permanently removed when you cancel it

### 3. Created Games Not Showing
**Problem:** The games table was missing several columns that the UI expected.

**Solution:** Created database migrations to add missing columns:
- `sport` - The sport type for the game
- `date` - Separate date field for easier querying
- `time` - Separate time field for display
- `duration` - Game duration in hours
- `skill_level` - Skill level requirement
- `host_name` - Name of the game host
- `status` - Game status (active, cancelled, completed)
- `cost_per_player` - Cost per player for the game

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations

You need to run two SQL migrations in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Navigate to the **SQL Editor**
3. Run these migrations in order:

#### Migration 1: Add Sport Column
```sql
-- From: supabase/01-add-sport-column.sql
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sport text;
```

#### Migration 2: Add All Missing Columns
```sql
-- From: supabase/07-add-missing-game-columns.sql
-- Add missing columns to games table
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sport text;
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS date date;
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS time time;
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS duration numeric DEFAULT 2;
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS skill_level text DEFAULT 'All Levels';
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS host_name text;
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status text DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'cancelled', 'completed'));
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS cost_per_player numeric DEFAULT 0;

-- Update existing games to populate the new columns
UPDATE games 
SET 
  date = DATE(start_time),
  time = start_time::time
WHERE date IS NULL OR time IS NULL;

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_games_date ON games(date);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_games_sport ON games(sport);
```

### Step 2: Test the Updated Features

1. **Sign in to your app** - The bookings page requires authentication

2. **Create a new game:**
   - Go to "Host a Game" 
   - Fill in the details
   - Submit the form
   - You should be redirected to the game details page

3. **Check your bookings:**
   - Go to "My Bookings"
   - Your newly created game should appear under "Games I'm Hosting"
   - You should see all game details properly displayed

4. **Test canceling a game:**
   - Click "Cancel Game" on one of your hosted games
   - Confirm the cancellation
   - The game should be permanently removed
   - Refresh the page to verify it's gone

5. **Test joining and leaving games:**
   - Join a game from the games list
   - Go to "My Bookings" â†’ "Games I've Joined"
   - Click "Leave Game" to leave it

## What Changed

### Frontend Changes
- **`/src/app/bookings/page.tsx`** - Complete rewrite to use real API data
- **`/src/app/api/games/route.ts`** - Enhanced to populate new database columns

### Database Changes
- Added 8 new columns to the `games` table
- Created indexes for better query performance
- Added proper constraints and defaults

### Features Added
- Real-time data fetching from database
- Proper game cancellation with database deletion
- Leave game functionality for joined games
- Loading states and error handling
- Success/error message displays

## Troubleshooting

### If games still don't appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure you're signed in
3. Verify the database migrations were applied
4. Check that your Supabase credentials are correct in `.env.local`

### If cancel doesn't work:
1. Check if you're authenticated
2. Verify you're the host of the game
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Ensure middleware is properly passing authentication

### If new games don't show up:
1. Refresh the bookings page
2. Check if the game was created (look in games list)
3. Verify all database columns exist
4. Check API response in browser network tab

## Next Steps

After applying these fixes, you may want to:
1. Add more game details (equipment needed, exact location, etc.)
2. Implement game editing functionality
3. Add email notifications for game updates
4. Create a game history view for completed games
5. Add user profiles with ratings and reviews
